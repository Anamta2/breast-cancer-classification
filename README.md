# Advanced Project on Breast Cancer Classification

This project explores and compares different machine learning models to classify breast cancer using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
- Preprocessed data and performed feature selection.
- Trained and evaluated multiple models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), etc.
- Compared models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualized results with confusion matrices and plots.

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- `advance-proj-on-breast-cancer-classification.ipynb`: Main notebook with complete code, explanations, and results.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- [Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)

## âœ… Results
- Achieved **98.25% accuracy** using Support Vector Machine (SVM) model.
- Compared multiple models and visualized results.
